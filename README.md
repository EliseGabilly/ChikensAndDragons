In this game, you control a dragon and your aim is to kill all the chickens and cows on the field.

You have to avoid the clouds to avoid taking damage, and pay attention to the clock to beat your destruction record.

It is possible to modify the options so that there are more or less animals and areas of interest for them.

There's even a locally saved table of successes and high scores.
